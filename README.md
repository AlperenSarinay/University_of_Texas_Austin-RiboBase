# RiboBase

RiboBase is a system to host all previously generated ribosome profiling data in a centralized repository. The main interface of the system is a web page. Though, for advanced use cases, we will implement a programmatic interface in Python.

The ribosome profiling data will have its metadata, sequencing data and analysis results all integrated. Using RiboBase, data visualization, analysis and comparison can be done seamlessly and uniformly via a web interface.
